# Dotfiles for NixOS Unstable
---
### Things to do / consider:
- ~Swap barbecue.nvim for dropbar.nvim~
- Add telescope-undo.nvim
- Add a working markdown plugin to nvim (right now it doesn't keep you in a list when you hit newline)
    - (looks like markdown.nvim is a good option)
- Add neogit
- Add openscad.nvim
- integrate ollama w/ nvim? (probably gen.nvim)
